# Deep Dive into Solana CU ü¶Ä

GM GM everyone üòÅ,

In this blog, we will go through the various types of Solana resource limitations you might encounter while developing smart contracts. You may run into errors containing words like "limit" or "exceed." These errors represent boundaries predefined by Solana programs to maintain fairness and performance on the blockchain. If you‚Äôd like to get more information on these topics, you‚Äôre in the right place!

Hear what u can expect from this blog:-

1. Types of limitations

- CU Limitations
- Storage Limitations
- transaction size limitations
- Call depth limitations
- Stack size
- PDA Accounts limitations

# Limitations of Solana:-

Solana is a high-performance public blockchain that stands apart from traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its unique approach to transaction processing separates logic and state into different accounts, which allows Solana to process many transactions simultaneously.

However, programs running on Solana are subject to several types of resource limitations. These limitations ensure that programs use system resources fairly while maintaining high performance.

Knowing these boundaries is very helpful for developers, as it guides them in building efficient and reliable program
